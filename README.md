## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my submission for the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - Base Apparel Coming Soon Page Challenge.

## The Challenge

The challenge is to build out this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
